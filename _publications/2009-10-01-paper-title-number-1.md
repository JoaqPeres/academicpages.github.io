excerpt: 'The ubiquity of Google Maps marks a profound shift in the nature and accessibility of map-making and mapreading tools. This is particularly true of its Google Street View service, in which hyperlink-studded panoramas are sutured into a navigable palimpsest of photographs, descriptions, and social interaction. Behind this newfound immersion is a massive photographic archive, which revives the totalizing intent and flawed classificatory practices of Alphonse Bertillon and the first photographic filing system. Both construct the image of a coherent whole via the reduction of identity, whether personal or local, to an ensemble of forced portraiture and physical description. This simplification rationalizes a program of surveillance, but the Google Local Guide community suggests an alternate local-archival capacity within the Maps platforms.'
